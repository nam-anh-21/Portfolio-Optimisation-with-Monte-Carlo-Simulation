# Portfolio Optimisation with Monte-Carlo Simulation

## 1. Introduction

The main objective of this project is to optimise a portfolio consisting of stocks from the VN30 index using Monte Carlo simulation. The VN30 is an index comprising the 30 largest companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) in Vietnam. These companies are often used as a benchmark for the overall performance of the Vietnamese market. By utilising historical stock data, my aim is to construct and evaluate multiple portfolios to find the optimal allocation that maximises the risk-adjusted return.

### 2.1. Closing Prices Visualisation

### 2.2. Risk and Return Analysis

The annual return and annual volatility of the stocks, and the relationship between them are calculated and visualised, of both 3 years and the whole dataset.

### 2.3. Portfolio Optimisation with Monte Carlo Simulation

- Portfolio Construction: A selection of stocks from the VN30 index is made to form the initial portfolio. In this project, a portfolio consisting of 10 stocks is chosen, then 20 stocks, and finally the portfolio is made from all stocks from VN30.
- Monte Carlo Simulation: Random portfolios are generated by assigning random weights to each stock in the portfolio. The number of portfolios generated is determined by the specified number of iterations.
- Portfolio Evaluation: For each randomly generated portfolio, key metrics such as annual return, annual volatility, and the Sharpe ratio are calculated. The Sharpe ratio serves as a measure of risk-adjusted return, helping to identify portfolios with superior performance.
- Optimization: The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio is identified as the optimal portfolio. This portfolio represents the allocation that provides the best balance between risk and return.
