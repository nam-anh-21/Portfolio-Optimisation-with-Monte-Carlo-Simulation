# Portfolio Optimisation with Monte Carlo Simulation

## 1. Introduction

The main objective of this project is to optimise a portfolio consisting of stocks from the VN30 index using Monte Carlo simulation. The VN30 is an index comprising the 30 largest companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) in Vietnam. These companies are often used as a benchmark for the overall performance of the Vietnamese market. By utilising historical stock data, my aim is to construct and evaluate multiple portfolios to find the optimal allocation that maximises the risk-adjusted return.

This project will conduct analysis on:
- Capital Asset Pricing Model
- Risk-Return
- Correlation
- Monte Carlo simulation


## 2. Result

The full code of this project is attached in this repository.

### 2.3. Risk-Return Analysis

![Risk-Return of Last 3 Years](https://github.com/namanh-ph/Portfolio-Optimisation-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulation/blob/main/Images/5.%20Risk-Return%20of%20Last%203%20Years.png)

Based on the stocks risk-return plots and Sharpe Ratios, 10 stocks are chosen to form a portfolio. This is the result.

### 2.4. Correlation-Covariance

The 10 stocks are then evaluated with their respective correlation and covariance.

### 2.5. Monte Carlo Simulation

- Portfolio Construction and Monte Carlo simulation: A selection of stocks from the VN30 index is made to form the initial portfolio. First, an equally weighted portfolio is analysed, then random portfolios are generated by assigning random weights to each stock in the portfolio. The number of portfolios generated is determined by the specified number of iterations.
- Portfolio Evaluation: For each randomly generated portfolio, key metrics such as annual return, annual volatility, and the Sharpe ratio are calculated. The Sharpe ratio serves as a measure of risk-adjusted return, helping to identify portfolios with superior performance. Sharpe ratios distribution of the random portfolios are evaluated as well.
- Portfolio Optimisation: The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio is identified as the optimal portfolio. This portfolio represents the allocation that provides the best balance between risk and return.
